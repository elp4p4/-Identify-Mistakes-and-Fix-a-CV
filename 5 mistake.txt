Mistake 1: Formatting Issues

Issue: The text lacks proper spacing, bullet alignment, and section separation, making it difficult to read.

Fix: Add proper spacing between sections and ensure bullets are aligned properly.

Example:

Before:

Professional ExperienceProject Manager Innovative Company – New York, USA 2020 - Current
● Managed various projects successfully.

After:


**Professional Experience**  
**Project Manager**  
Innovative Company – New York, USA (2020 - Present)  
- Managed various projects successfully.


Mistake 2: Inconsistent Job Title Formatting

Issue: Job titles are not bold or clearly separated from the company names.

Fix: Bold job titles for clarity.

Example:

Before:

Web Developer Startup Dynamic – Los Angeles, USA May 2018 to Dec 2019

After:

Web Developer
Startup Dynamic – Los Angeles, USA (May 2018 – Dec 2019)

Mistake 3: Lack of Actionable Details in Bullet Points

Issue: The bullet points are too vague and do not provide measurable results.

Fix: Add numbers, metrics, or specifics where possible.

Example:

Before:

Managed various projects successfully.

After:

Led 5+ cross-functional projects, improving efficiency by 20%.

Mistake 4: Missing Consistency in Date Formatting

Issue: The resume uses "May 2018 to Dec 2019" but "2020 - Current."

Fix: Standardize the date format across all entries.

Example:

Before:

2020 - Current
May 2018 to Dec 2019

After:

2020 – Present
May 2018 – December 2019

Mistake 5: "University of Los Angeles" is Not a Real Institution

Issue: "University of Los Angeles" does not exist. This should be corrected or clarified.

Fix: Use "University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)" if referring to the correct institution.

Example:

Before:

Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles

After:

Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
